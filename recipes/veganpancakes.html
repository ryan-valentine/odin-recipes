        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a delicious pancake recipe that I used to make Sasha
            almost every Sunday. Lately I've not been making it quite so often,
            but perhaps this weekend!</p>
        <p>Either way, I hope you enjoy!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Flour
            <li>2 TBSP Coconut Sugar
            <li>1 TBSP Baking Powder
            <li>1/2 TSP Salt
            <li>1 Cup Almond Milk
            <li>1 TBSP Apple Cider Vinegar
            <li>1 TBSP Almond Extract
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl combine the flour, coconut sucar, baking powder and salt. You can sift these together or mix thoroughly with a whisk.
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk and apple cider vinegar. Let sit 5 minutes.
            <li>Add the vanilla extract to the almond milk and apple cider vinegar concoction.
            <li><em>Gently</em> mix the wet ingredients into the dry. Do not overmnix or the pancakes will be tough. The final mixture may be slightly lumpy.
            <li>Cook like pancakes on a sillet over medium heat!
        </ol>
        <p>If you really want to make your pancakes great, add walnuts or some shit, I don't care!</p>
